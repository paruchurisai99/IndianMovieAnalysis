# IndianMovieAnalysis

## Data cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the Indian Movie dataset.


I took an Indian Movie dataset from Kaggle and then normalized the table in SQL server database. The goal is to improve integrity, reduce redundancy, and enhance data manipulation efficiency.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:

The original "IndianMovies" table likely contained redundant information and inconsistencies. I have addressed these issues by:
* Splitting multi-valued columns (e.g., Genre) into separate tables.
* Creating new tables to group related data (e.g., Genres, Languages).
* Establishing relationships between tables using foreign keys.
* Removing duplicate data.
* Setting primary keys for each table.
* Cleaning and transforming data for consistency.
* Data Cleaning and Normalization Steps


Data Exploration and Analysis: 

After cleaning and transforming the data, several queries were executed to explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
